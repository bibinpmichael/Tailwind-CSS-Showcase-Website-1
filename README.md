## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository or download the HTML file.
2. Open the HTML file in your web browser to view the landing page.

No build process is required as this project uses Tailwind CSS via CDN.

## Project Structure

The project consists of a single `index.html` file with the following structure:

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <!-- CSS links -->
  </head>
  <body>
    <header>
      <!-- Navigation and hero section -->
    </header>
    <main>
      <!-- Main content sections -->
    </main>
    <footer>
      <!-- Footer content -->
    </footer>
  </body>
</html>
```

## Customization

To customize the landing page:

1. Open the `index.html` file in your text editor.
2. Modify the content within the HTML tags to change text, images, and layout.
3. Adjust Tailwind CSS classes to alter styling, spacing, and responsiveness.
4. For more extensive customization, consider setting up a local Tailwind CSS build process to optimize for production.
